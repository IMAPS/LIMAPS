6. IMAPS team suggests to include a question related to GDPR aspects. Currently, we assessing these aspects only in the IMAPS questionnaire. 

Example: ‘Are the necessary for processing person related data and rights considered according to the GDPR and are they protected accordingly?’
Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

7. IMAPS team suggests this item: ‘Have formal requirements such as, e.g. written form, proof of identity, authentication or personal appearance been checked if they can be eliminated or simplified as part of the digitalisation?’ 
Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)

9. The IMAPS team uses the term (legal) "interoperability specifications" for consistency across all IMAPS questionnaires.

However, for items D6, C3, C4 (LIMAPS) we think that the term "legal mandate" best serves the purpose of the question. 
Can you please confirm and/or provide advice on the use of the term "legal mandate"? (Yes/No | Rationale)
