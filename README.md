# LIMAPS
LIMAPS (Legal Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service) is a user-friendly online questionnaire, designed as a self-assessment tool to assist public service owners to evaluate key legal interoperability aspects of their digital public service.

Legal interoperability focuses on the legal provisions that regulate the collaboration among different public administrations that operate under different legal mandates, as well as on limitations of data, information, knowledge share and reuse, and also, to legal interoperability enablers and manifestations that resolve legal incompatibilities and facilitate the interaction of the digital public services with its end users and other client services.

LIMAPS is fully compliant with the latest version of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

LIMAPS serves complementary to the IMAPS survey and its use is recommended in conjunction with IMAPS, to vertically assess the behavioural aspects of a digital public service, from the legal behavioural interoperability viewpoint. You may visit the latest vesrion of the IMAPS questionnare here: https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/IMAPS-v1_2_0 and the respective documentation can be found in this link https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/imaps-interoperability-maturity-assessment-public-service/solution/imaps/release/v120.

On completion of the survey, the public service owners receive tailored feedback and recommendations on how to further improve their service in terms of legal interoperability.
